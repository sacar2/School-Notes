# 07: Mesh Data Structures

## **Properties of Meshes**

* **Solidity**: A mesh represents a solid object if its faces together enclose a finite amount of space.
* **Connectedness**: A mesh is connected if every face shares at least one edge with some other face.
* **Simplicity**: A mesh is simple if the object it represents is solid and has no holes through it.
* **Planarity**: A mesh is planar if every face is a planar polygon.
* **Convexity**: A mesh is **convex** if the line connecting any two points within the object lies wholly inside the mesh object.
